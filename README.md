# Analysis of T Cell Populations in Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid during Latent HIV-1 Infection 
This repository is for Problem Set 8 to replicate the figures, analyses, and scripts accompanying the final paper for 20.440. The content contained in this repository make up the majority of the supplementary figures, as they deal with imputation method comparisons as well as initial data analysis with Seurat.

## Data Source
To understand the characteristic gene expression features of HIV+ and HIV- patients, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells were obtained using SeqWell methodology <sup>1</sup>.  Datasets from Farhadian, et. al. included CSF scRNA-seq data from 3 HIV+ and 2 HIV- patients; for 2 of the HIV+ patients, matched blood scRNA-seq data was included. The patients were males between the ages of 33 and 59, with varied histories of substance use, alcohol use, and smoking, matched between the patient and control populations. This data is also available on GEO associated with the ID [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117397).
